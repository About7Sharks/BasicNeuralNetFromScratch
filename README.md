### Input Data
|      | Inputs | Outputs |
| ----------- | ----------- |----------- |
| Example 1 | [0,0,1] | 0 |
| Example 2 | [1,1,1] | 1 |
| Example 3 | [1,0,1] | 1 |
| Example 4 | [0,1,1] | 0 |

Demonstrates how a neural network learns based off of training data. Weights are being recalulated after every iteration to tune output data. Changing the iteration amount will improve the accuracy of the results.
